# 🚗 Car Dataset Analysis – Excel Project

## 📌 Overview
This project was done as part of my Data Science learning journey.  
Using Excel, I analyzed car datasets to uncover trends in mileage, engine size, fuel efficiency, and brand performance. The study also covers correlation insights, outlier impacts, and business recommendations for manufacturers.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Dzire (Suzuki) gives the best mileage.  
- Tata Nano: small engine + good efficiency.  
- Maruti Suzuki: most fuel-efficient cars.  
- Segment leaders → Suzuki (hatchbacks), Hyundai (sedans), Mahindra (SUVs).  
- Hyundai competes strongly across all body types.  

### Correlation Findings
- Bigger engines → lower mileage.  
- Fuel tank size has little effect on mileage.  
- Heavier cars are less efficient.  
- Larger engines generally have larger tanks.  

### Outlier Impact
- Outliers strongly influence overall mileage and efficiency trends.  

### Variants & Market
- Maruti Suzuki offers the most hatchback variants.  
- Hyundai follows in hatchbacks and SUVs.  
- Sedans, MUVs, and crossovers are limited in options.

## 🚀 Recommendations
1. Focus more on **hatchbacks** (most preferred).  
2. Build **lightweight models** for higher efficiency.  
3. Balance **engine size and mileage** for broad appeal.  
4. Explore **sedan/coupe markets** for new opportunities.  
5. Diversify variants in **MUVs and crossovers**.  
6. Apply **data-driven pricing strategies**.  
7. Promote **family and adventure cars** (e.g., BMW X7, BMW X4).  
8. Educate customers with simple comparisons (e.g., small cars = more mileage).
